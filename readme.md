### Preparing for the Rithm School Timed Coding Challenge

Congratulations on making it past the timed coding challenge! It's time to practice a bit with some more problems to make sure you're ready to continue learning more.

To best prepare for the final stage of the Rithm School interview, make sure that you can solve each of these functions. You can also download a zip file with all of these functions and an HTML file that you can open to run automated tests to ensure you have solved the problem correctly.

[Download a zip file containing tests and practice problems here](https://github.com/rithmschool/rithm-interview-prep-practice-part-2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

### Running the tests for each practice problem

Once you download the zip file containing the tests and practice problems, unzip the file and take a look at the contents of the folder. You will see that there is a JavaScript file for each problem that you need to solve.

You will also see that there is a `readme.md` file which contains instructions for each problem (you can also find these instructions below).

To make sure that you have solved each problem correctly, there is a file called `tests.js` which contain automated tests that will let you know if your solution is correct. Do not modify any code inside here, you do not need to write any tests yourself! To run these tests, open up the `index.html` file in a browser and when you do, you will see a series of red Xs which indicate that tests are failing.

When you open the `index.html` file, we recommend you click on the Spec List so that you can see each function and the tests associated with it. From there, you can click on an individual function to see only the tests for that specific function.

Once you have solved the problem correctly, the tests will pass and you will see green text instead of red.

We also recommend clicking on the Options button and unchecking the box for "run tests in random order".

Each of the tests check the example input and output that we provide for each problem, so if a test is failing, try the examples we provide for each function to make sure they are all working.

### How to work through the practice problems

Before continuing to the list of problems, it's essential you develop some good habits around programming and practicing problem solving.

- Don't start coding right away, take some time to write down your thoughts and problem solving process
- **Do not** look at the solution before solving the problem!
- Make sure to run the tests for each practice problem.
